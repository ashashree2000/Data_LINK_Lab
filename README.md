## Description
This repository hosts a data pipeline that automates the process of monitoring reports from the Himachal Pradesh Treasury portal. The pipeline collects data for a specified date range and report type, cleans the data, and stores it in an SQLite database. This README provides an overview of the project and instructions for its setup and usage.

## Folder Structure

The project's folder structure is organized as follows:

- `dll_data_cleaningand_aqlite.py`: This script contains .
- `python_script_2.py`: Description of what this script does.
- `data.xlsx`: Excel spreadsheet in spreadsheet format.
- `data.db`: SQLite database file.


 - `data_collection.py` : Web scraping script to collect data.
  - `data_cleaning.py` : Data cleaning and preprocessing script.
  - `data_storage.py` : Script to store cleaned data in an SQLite database.
- `docs/` : Documentation folder.
  - `README.md` : This documentation file.
- `data/` : Data folder.
  - `cleaned_data.csv` : Cleaned data in CSV format.
- `your_database.db` : SQLite database file.
- `README.md` : Repository-wide README file.

## Dependencies

List any external libraries or packages that your Python scripts depend on. Include installation instructions if needed.

- Library1 (e.g., pandas)
- Library2 (e.g., matplotlib)

You can also mention any versions of these libraries that are known to work with your project.

## Usage

### Running Python Scripts on Google Colab

1. Open Google Colab.
2. Upload the Python scripts (`python_script_1.py` and `python_script_2.py`) to your Colab workspace.
3. Open each script in Colab and follow the instructions within the script comments.

### Using the Excel Spreadsheet

Describe how to use the data from `data.xlsx`. Provide examples or code snippets if necessary.

### Using the SQLite Database

Explain how to interact with the SQLite database `data.db`. Provide code examples for common database operations.
